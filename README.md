The **Interdisciplinary Data Science Lab (IDSL)** works to solve problems in biomedical informatics and computer science by developing novel artificial intelligence/machine learning methods that can leverage a problem’s underlying morphology and work within its operational limitations.

We then translate these techniques to commercial settings where they may make a broader impact on society.
